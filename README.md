# rock-paper-scissors

A javascript based game of rock paper scissors with light styling.

What I learned
-How to randomize in JS
-How to add sounds to websites
-How to manipulate the DOM

What I would improve
-Code should be refactored into a single playerchoice() perhaps using button.innertext to get the the players choice instead of having a different set of functions for each choice.
